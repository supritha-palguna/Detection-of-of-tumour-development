# Detection of tumour development

Cancer remains a significant challenge to human health, and the complex molecular
mechanisms underlying its development are a subject of extensive research. This project
focuses on studying mice that were fed two different types of diets: Standard diet (SD)
and Western diet (WD) or High-fat diet (HFD). We explore gene expression analysis
and tumor classification, aiming to shed light on the critical genetic factors contributing
to the development of a tumor. The main objective of this research is to accurately
classify tumor development in mice fed with a Western diet.

This project revolves around gene expression data,which provides information about how
genes behave in response to different diets. The goal here is to uncover the genes which
might be responsible for tumor development in mice when they consume a Western diet.
To achieve this, we employ a comprehensive methodology that involves several stages,
including data preprocessing, feature selection, machine learning based classification,
and filtering methods.
